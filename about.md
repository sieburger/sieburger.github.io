title: About
---

My name is Márcio, I am Brazilian from the southernmost part of the country, near Uruguay and live in a city called Canoas in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
I've been working with technology since I was fourteen years old, where I learned to solder components and repair radios and televisions in my Uncle José Carlos's repair shop!

In addition to the passion for life, family and friends, I also cultivate other interests that blend into the day to day with work and fun.

And as we never stop studying in this life we still have many things to discover in the vast universe of knowledge accessible to all.
